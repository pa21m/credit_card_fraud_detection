The ability to identify fraud with higher recall as demonstrated by threshold tuning, means fewer fraudulent transactions go undetected, leading to direct cost savings. Conversely, the focus on precision helps minimize false positives, which are costly in terms of customer dissatisfaction, manual review efforts, and potential loss of legitimate transactions. This targeted approach ensures that fraud prevention efforts are efficient and customer-friendly."
